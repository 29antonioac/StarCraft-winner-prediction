Game have always been a target of researchers in a lot of Science fields:
mathematics, economy, psychology... In Artificial Intelligence is very usual
using them as a testing bench for algorithms or theories to resolve complex
problems, due to their simple specification but complex modelling.

In this work the results of a well-known real time strategy videogame,
\emph{StarCraft}, using supervised learning with \emph{Big Data} tools,
letting us work with a very large dataset without problem.

We will prove that \improvement{Add conclusion}{...}
