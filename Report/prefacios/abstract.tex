Game have always been a target of researchers in a lot of Science fields:
mathematics, economy, psychology... In Artificial Intelligence is very usual
using them as a testing bench for algorithms or theories to resolve complex
problems, due to their simple specification but complex modelling.

In this work the results of a well-known real time strategy videogame,
\emph{StarCraft}, using supervised learning with \emph{Big Data} tools,
letting us work with a very large dataset without problem.

We will prove that with appropiate data and tools it is possible to
predict the outcome of matches, explaining why using the best predictos for
each model.
