# StarCraft-winner-prediction
Using supervised learning to predict the winner of a match.

To see the report (in Spanish only), compile it using

```
make
```
under the Report folder. You have to have `R` and `knitr` installed
in your system.

Install `R` with your package manager, and `knitr` using the `R` terminal,
typing

```
install.packages("knitr")
```

To execute all the code you need `Scala` and `Spark`. At the moment it's
a work in progress.
