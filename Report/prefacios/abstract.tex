% Game have always been a target of researchers in a lot of Science fields:

In this work it has been proposed to model the matches' outcomes of the very
well-known real time strategy videogame \emph{StarCraft}. Supervised learning
will be used, so the winner of a match could be predicted using automatically
generated data from the players.

To do this it has been proposed to do a complete process of Knowledge Data
Discovering \emph{KDD} on a relational database, which is very large: it
contains more than 4500 matches, every one with a big amount of possible
features to use. It will be selected interesant and understable features to
get good predictions and explainable ones. In this way the game could be
well-known and get useful predictions.

When the data is completely organised, it will apply techniques to extract
useful information: the winner of a match in an early moment and the features
that explain this prediction. Due to the problem's dimension, used techniques
must be ready to deal with a big amount of data, so Apache ecosystem will
be used: \emph{Spark} together with the machine learning library \emph{MLlib}.
This choice will allow an usual desktop computer to deal with all this data
without any problems.

As a result of this proyect we will obtain a set of models which are able to
predict the winner of a match with a big accuracy. Furthermore, some of this
models have a ranking of features by importance. With this ranking, features
could be analyzed for each model, allowing the researcher to understand better
why a player wins, completing the previous analysis and works of this complex
videogame.
