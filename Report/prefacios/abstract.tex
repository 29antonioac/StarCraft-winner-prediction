Game have always been a target of researchers in a lot of Science fields:
mathematics, economy, psychology... In Artificial Intelligence is very usual
to use them as a testing bench for algorithms or theories to resolve complex
problems, due to their simple specification but complex modelling.

In this work the results of a well-known real time strategy videogame will be
modelled,
\emph{StarCraft}, using supervised learning with \emph{Big Data} tools, which
will allow us to work with a very large dataset without problem.

We will prove that with appropiate data and tools it is possible to
predict the outcome of matches, explaining why using the best predictors for
each model.
